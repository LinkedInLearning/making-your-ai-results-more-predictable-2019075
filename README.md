## Course Description

Explore the fundamentals of working with AI and large language models, focusing on responsible usage, the intricacies of writing effective user prompts, and how to ensure human oversight while implementing strong, reliable systems. Instructor Ronnie Sheers shows you practical ways to recognize and mitigate biases, hallucinations, and randomness in AI outputs, as well as how to leverage system instructions for improved interaction efficiency. Get started applying few-shot learning techniques to generalize data more effectively. Find out why keeping a human in the loop enhances decision-making and accountability while also ensuring ethical system design through user feedback and risk management. Along the way, learn how to use moderation components, fine-tuning models for specific tasks, semantic similarity searches for better information retrieval, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for enhanced system performance.
